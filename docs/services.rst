Services
==========

:doc:`github` class is a glue to all of them and the recommended option to
start

Overview
----------

You can access to the API requests through the different services.

If you take a look at
`github API v3 documentation <http://developer.github.com/>`_, you'll see a
few sections in the sidebar.

**pygithub3** has one service per each section of request-related

For example: ::

    repos => services.repos.repo
        collaborators => services.repos.collaborators
        commits => services.repos.commits
        ....

Each service has the functions to throw the API requests and **is isolated
from the rest**.

Each service can be configurated with some variables (behind the scenes, each
service has her client which is configurated with this variables).

    Also you can configure :doc:`github` as a service
